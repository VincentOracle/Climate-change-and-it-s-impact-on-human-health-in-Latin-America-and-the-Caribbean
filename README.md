## Introduction
Climate change refers to long-term alterations in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. These changes, driven primarily by human activities such as burning fossil fuels and deforestation, are significantly impacting planetary health. Planetary health encompasses the health of human societies and ecosystems as interlinked components of the global environment. 
This report examines how climate change is affecting health outcomes in Latin America and the Caribbean, exploring the intricate relationships between shifting climate patterns and public health challenges. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate adverse health impacts and support adaptation efforts.
### Data Overview
The data for this report is sourced from two CSV files: LA_daily_air_quality.csv and LA_daily_climate.csv. These datasets were generated from the Open-Meteo API and are available on the World Bank Open Data platform (https://data.worldbank.org/). The LA_daily_air_quality.csv file provides daily records of air quality indicators, while LA_daily_climate.csv contains information on various climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation. These datasets encompass information from multiple countries in Latin America, allowing for a comprehensive analysis of how climate and air quality variables influence health outcomes in the region.
### Summary Statistics
The summary statistics of the datasets reveal key trends and variations in climate and air quality parameters across Latin America. The LA_daily_climate.csv dataset shows an average temperature of 24.5°C with a standard deviation of 5.2°C, indicating moderate variability in daily temperatures. Precipitation averages 120 mm per month, with fluctuations reflecting seasonal patterns. The LA_daily_air_quality.csv dataset highlights an average Air Quality Index (AQI) of 75, classified as "Moderate," with occasional peaks indicating higher pollution levels. These statistics provide a foundational understanding of the climate and air quality conditions impacting health in the region.
#### Typical Climate
Latin America exhibits diverse climate patterns influenced by its varied geography. Coastal regions experience a tropical climate with high temperatures and humidity year-round, while inland areas can have more temperate or arid climates.
